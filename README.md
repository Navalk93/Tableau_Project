Dashboard Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/naval.kishore4433/viz/Tableau_ProjectCovid19/Dashboard2

Domain: Healthcare, Covid-19

Objective: The objective of this project is to understand the global covid-19 mortalityrates.


Problem statement:

Based on the csv. files for global mortality rates, we are going to analyze and develop a dashboard to understand the covid-19 global cases. Use filters, parameters and actions wherever possible to make the dashboard interactive. 

1) Comparing the global confirmed vs. death cases in a world map using piecharts.

2) Top 5 countries based on confirmed and death cases in numbers.

3) Create a parameter for percentile comparison between countries based on confirmed cases.

4) Comparing the country wise cases using logarithmic axes. Dashboard should display both log axis chart and a default axis chart in the dashboard.

5) New cases per day in China and India – compared in a date wise chart.

6) Which day has the highest new death cases in each month?

7) Which WHO region has the highest new cases verses new deaths ratio?

8) Create a parameter to dynamically view Top N WHO regions based on cumulative new cases and death cases ratio.

9) Average WHO region wise cumulative cases to be visualized using a funnel chart.

10) Dashboard should have a drop down menu to view the WHO region wise data using a bar chart, line chart or a map as per user’s requirement.
